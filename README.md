# jemalloc

Instant [jemalloc](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/) injection into Ruby apps, for better performance and less memory.

# Why jemalloc?

Ruby relies on malloc(3) for its internal memory allocation. Using a better malloc() implementation will boost your application's performance, and reduce it's memory usage.

jemalloc is a malloc(3) implementation, originally developed by Jason Evans. jemalloc handles small objects better than other allocators, so it usually gives better performance and memory usage to Ruby programs.

# Why jemalloc?

Installing jemalloc separately from Ruby is pain in some cases (e.g. Heroku, EngineYard, etc). `je` gem contains jemalloc itself within a gem, and enables instant jemalloc injection in a really easy way: install `je` gem, and launch your app with `je` command.

# Install

Install `jemalloc` gem in your application. For [bundler](http://gembundler.com/) based applications, please add the following line into your Gemfile, and and install `jemalloc` by `bundle install`.

    gem 'jemalloc'

# Usage

Execute your application with `je` command, which is contained in `je` gem. Example command for Rails + bundler application is like follows.

    $ bundle exec je ./script/rails s

`-v` option will let you confirm jemalloc is actually injected.

    $ bundle exec je -v ./script/rails s
    => Injecting jemalloc...
    => Booting WEBrick
    ...

# Advanced: Valgrind

Jemalloc is built to use [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) by default. As Valgrind is not installed on Mac systems or on Heroku, this gem disables Valgrind by using `--disable-valgrind` during the configure process.

You can enable Valgrind by specifying: `bundle config build.jemalloc --with-valgrind` before installing jemalloc-rb using Bundler.

Please note, if you want to enable Valgrind for all projects which use Bundler, you need to use the `--global` flag, e.g. `bundle config --global build.jemalloc --with-valgrind`

# Limitation

Currently, this gem works only on Linux and Mac OS X.
